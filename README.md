# sonosruby
Ruby/applescript for syncing up sonos and itunes players


## Installation/Usage
Download sonosruby.rb and then execute with `ruby sonosruby.rb`. This will start a listener on for when the sonos song changes, and update the current itunes song accordingly

## Notes
* The listener takes effect on song change, so you will need to skip a song before the syncing process starts
* The syncing isn't perfect and may need to be tweaked depending on your connection to sonos/itunes settings
